dev tools are a series of tools I've wrote to help me with the Ren'py developement, specially with the screens and minigames.

How to install:
  put the script files into your game folder, perfably a folder for all of the tools you might add.
  
## How to use:
  you need to add "dev tools.rpy" to your game then you can press ~ buttin (under Esc) to toggle the menu containing all of the tools you've added to your game.
  any tool you add to your folder will be added to this menu automatically and there no need to modify the scripts.

## List of all tools:

  dev tools.rpy
    the base menu.
    
  mouse pos.rpy
    shows the position of the mouse and the option to copy the mouse pos() or align() on the games screen.
  
  color pick.rpy
    allows selecting and storing colors on the screen. (almost ready)
  
  screen runner.rpy
    allows running screens you're working on anywhere in the game by adding them to a list.
    
  deja.rpy
    allows viewing and picking of unicode characters in your font. (under development)
  
  theme colors.rpy
    theme colors selection for 0GUI(under development)
  
  
## Functions:
  the functions needed for dev tools to work:
  
  clip.rpy
    provides the clip_put function used by some tools.
    Function(clip_put, "information to copy")
