**0GUI**

Is a simplified version of Ren'Py interface for GUI designers. The major differences between 0GUI and the default Ren'py GUI generated with new games are:

- All of the GUI related code and style are removed from screens, making it easy to change them directly without worrying about the errors.
- All comments are removed, pros don't need those (will add back renpy licensing  at some point)
- The screens are broken into files for faster access and less scrolling.
- The interface is animated with a single transform, making it easy to get a new look out of the interface animation with few changes.
- A set of click SFX is added to the buttons. 
- The style of screen elements can be changed by modifying few lines of code. 
- It is independent of any images, you can remove everything in GUI folder except the window icon.
- You can remove or change part of the interface by simply removing or swapping their files, no coding required.
- Additional functions are added to the interface
- It is being improved constantly
- it looks good out of the box
- Mobile variations are developed separately and fitted for touch. and you can swap two folders for different builds instead of including both interfaces in the build.
- The look of interface can be changed by giving it a small image to use as frame


here's an old video of how easy it is to modify the interface with 0GUI

**How to**

adding 0GUI to a project is easy:
- Remove screens.rpy and screens.rpyc
- Copy 0GUI folder to your game folder and you're all set

As an optional step, you can remove all images inside the GUI folder except the window icon
here's a video showing me doing it, *gigle*

**License**

The majority of 0GUI and 0GUIM is modified code from default Ren'py interface, therefore, the license is the same as everything else in Ren'py: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/license.html

**unless you're adam_9847 from reddit, you can't benefit from any work of mine and when you use my work for free you need to add my name in the middle of every screen with largest font size that fits the whole screen. Don't go around my patreon sniffing the good stuff either.**

**Plugs**

If anyone deserves to be supported is RenpyTom https://www.patreon.com/renpytom for all the effort he has put into Ren'py. Though, I wouldn't mind some of the attention either. You can find some interesting stuff on my patreon page too: https://www.patreon.com/KiaAzad mostly free stuff.
