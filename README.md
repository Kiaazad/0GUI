0GUI is a simplified version of Ren'Py interface for GUI designers. The major diferences between 0GUI and the default Ren'py GUI generated with new games are:

- The screens are broken into files for faster access.
- The interface is animated.
- A set of click SFX is added to the buttons. 
- The style of screen elements can be changed by modifying few lines of code. 
- It is independent of any images, you can remove everything in GUI folder except the window icon.
- You can remove some screens simply by removing their files (comming soon)
- Additional functions are added to the interface
- It is being improved constantly
